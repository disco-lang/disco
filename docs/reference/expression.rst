Expressions
===========

An *expression* is some combination of values, operators, and
functions which describes a *value* (turning an expression into a
value is called *evaluation*).

Examples of expressions in Disco include:

* ``5`` (a single :doc:`number <numeric>`, :doc:`string <string>`,
  :doc:`boolean <bool>`, :doc:`variable <variable>`, etc. by itself is
  an expression)
* ``1 + 2`` (two or more expressions combined by :doc:`operators
  <operator>` is again an expression)
* ``f(x,3) * g(2)`` (:doc:`function <function>` calls are expressions)

Examples of things which are *not* expressions include:

* ``x : N`` (this is a :doc:`type signature <type-sig>`, not an expression; it does not
  have a value, it says what the type of ``x`` is)
* ``x = 3`` (this is a :doc:`definition <definition>`)

.. warning::

   Be careful not to confuse ``x = 3`` (a :doc:`definition <definition>`
   of the :doc:`variable <variable>` ``x``) with ``x == 3`` (a
   :doc:`comparison <compare>` expression which has a value of either
   ``T`` or ``F`` depending on whether ``x`` is equal to ``3`` or
   not).  See :doc:`def-vs-test`.
