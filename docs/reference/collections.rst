Collections
===========

Disco has several built-in collection types (such as :doc:`lists
<list>`, :doc:`bags <bag>`, and :doc:`sets <set>`) which represent
collections of values.  The pages linked below explain the different
ways to create and use collections, and the operations which can be
used on them.
