Collections
===========

Disco has several built-in :doc:`collection types <collection-types>`
(such as :doc:`lists <list>`, :doc:`bags <bag>`, and :doc:`sets <set>`)
which represent collections of values.  The pages linked below explain
the different ways to create and use collections, and the operations
which can be used on them.
