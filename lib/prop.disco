using Primitives

||| Decide whether a proposition holds, *i.e.* convert it to a boolean.
||| Note, however, that for some propositions this may run forever.
||| For example, `holds (forall (x:N). x >= 0)` will run forever
||| trying to check all natural numbers to see if they are all
||| nonnegative.
|||
||| XXX what to do if you want to do randomized testing instead.

!!! holds (true : Prop) == true
holds : Prop -> Bool
holds = $holds
