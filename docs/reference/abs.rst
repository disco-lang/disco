Absolute value
==============

The absolute value function applied to a number ``x`` can be written
either ``abs(x)`` or using the traditional notation ``|x|``.

::

   Disco> abs(6)
   6
   Disco> abs(-6)
   6
   Disco> abs(-1/2)
   1/2
   Disco> |-6|
   6

Since the output of ``abs`` is always positive, it can convert
:doc:`rational numbers <rational>` into :doc:`fractional numbers <fraction>`,
and :doc:`integers <integer>` into :doc:`natural numbers <natural>`.

The notation ``|~|`` can also be used to find the :doc:`size <size>`
of a collection such as a :doc:`set <set>`, :doc:`bag <bag>`, or
:doc:`list <list>`.
