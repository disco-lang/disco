Error messages
==============

There are many different error messages Disco can generate when
something is wrong.  Each page linked below gives more explanation and
background to help you understand a particular error message.

The error messages in Disco are currently undergoing major
improvements.  If you have a suggestion on how a particular error
message could be improved, please record it at
