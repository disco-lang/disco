Comments
========

Comments in Disco can be written using ``--``.  Anything from ``--``
to the end of the line is a *comment* which Disco will ignore.
Comments can be used to write notes to yourself or explanations to
others, to write your name in a ``.disco`` file, and so on.

See also :doc:`documentation <docs>`, which is a special kind of
comment using ``|||`` instead of ``--``.
