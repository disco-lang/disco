Duplicate definition for x
==========================

Just as each :doc:`variable <variable>` can :doc:`only have one type
signature <dup-sig>`, so each variable can only have one
:doc:`definition <definition>`.
This is quite different than some other languages.  See the
:doc:`documentation about definitions <definition>` for more information.
