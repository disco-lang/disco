Gentle Introduction to Disco
============================

This Gentle Introduction starts from nothing and guides beginners
through a series of short lessons with exercises, introducing the
`Disco language`_ from the ground up, one small bit at a time.

Note that the gentle introduction contains many links to the
:doc:`Disco language reference </reference/index>`.  It is not necessary to
click these links; they are there just in case you want to know
