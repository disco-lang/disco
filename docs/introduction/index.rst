Gentle Introduction to Disco
============================

This Gentle Introduction starts from nothing and guides beginners
through a series of short lessons with exercises, introducing the
`Disco language`_ from the ground up, one small bit at a time.

.. _`Disco language`: https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/#readme

**The Gentle Introduction is currently (Spring 2024) under construction,
check back later for more!**

Note that the gentle introduction contains many links to the
:doc:`Disco language reference </reference/index>`.  It is not necessary to
click these links; they are there just in case you want to know
more detail on some particular topic.
