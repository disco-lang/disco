                  Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
                  radically changed the intellectual landscape of
                  introductory computing courses. Instead of teaching
                  some currently fashionable programming language, it
                  employed Scheme and functional programming to teach
                  important ideas. Introductory courses based on the
                  book showed up around the world and made Scheme and
                  functional programming popular. Unfortunately, these
                  courses quickly disappeared again due to
                  shortcomings of the book and the whimsies of
                  Scheme. Worse, the experiment left people with a bad
                  impression of Scheme and functional programming in
                  general. In this pearl, we propose an alternative
                  role for functional programming in the first-year
                  curriculum. Specifically, we present a framework for
                  discussing the first-year curriculum and, based on
                  it, the design rationale for our book and course,
                  dubbed How to Design Programs. The approach
                  emphasizes the systematic design of
                  programs. Experience shows that it works extremely
                  well as a preparation for a course on
                  object-oriented programming.}, number={4},
