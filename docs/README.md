Documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and
hosted on [readthedocs.io](htts://readthedocs.io).

Contributing to the documentation can be done in the same way as contributing to
any other part of the project. Commits pushed to the `master` branch on GitHub
are automatically built and hosted at
[https://disco-lang.readthedocs/io](https://disco-lang.readthedocs/io).

To build the documentation locally, first install Sphinx and the Sphinx theme
for readthedocs with

    pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme

Then you should be able to build with `make`:

    cd docs
    make html

Now point your browser at `docs/_build/html/index.html` to view.

When contributing to the documentation, you are highly encouraged to build it
locally to make sure it looks good before pushing/opening a pull request/etc.
However, if you are unable to, it's not absolutely necessary.

Documentation is written using
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html). See the linked
documentation for information, including tutorials and reference material; or
just look at some existing Disco documentation and copy the syntax!
