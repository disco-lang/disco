  - Possibly true: ∀x. x == 0 \/ (∃n. n * x >= 1)
    Checked 100 possibilities without finding a counterexample.
  - Certainly true: ∀f. any([∀x. f(x) == not x, ∀x. f(x) == x, ∀x. f(x) == F, ∀x. f(x) == T])
    No counterexamples exist; all possible values were checked.
  - Certainly false: all([T, T, T, F, T])
  - Certainly true: ∃k. hasFactors(2 ^ k + 1)
    Found example:
      k = 3
      n = 3
