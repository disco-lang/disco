-- Each of the functions below is a bijection.  Define another Disco
-- function which is its inverse, and write properties showing that
-- the functions are inverse.  Part (a) has already been done for you
-- as an example.  Part (b) has been done partially.  You should
-- complete parts (c)-(g) on your own.

-- (a) --------------------------------------------------

f1 : Z -> Z
f1(n) = n - 5

-- EXAMPLE SOLUTION for part (a).  Definition of g1 as the inverse of
-- f1, with two test properties demonstrating they are inverse.

!!! forall z:Z. f1(g1(z)) == z
!!! forall z:Z. g1(f1(z)) == z

g1 : Z -> Z
g1(n) = n + 5

-- (b) --------------------------------------------------

f2 : Q -> Q
f2(x) = 2x + 1

-- PARTIAL SOLUTION for part (b).  Some test properties and a type
-- declaration for g2; you should fill in a definition for g2.

!!! forall x:Q. f2(g2(x)) == x
!!! forall x:Q. g2(f2(x)) == x

g2 : Q -> Q
