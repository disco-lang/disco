Disco Language Reference
========================

The Disco Language Reference consists of a number of short,
interlinked pages, each centered on a single topic.  This is not a
typical "language reference", which would be intended for language
implementers and organized according to syntax, type system,
semantics, and so on.  Neither is it a comprehensive tutorial meant to
be read from start to finish.  Rather, it is intended to be a
reference for students who are just learning the language.  Error
messages and other documentation may link here, giving students the
opportunity to learn about specific topics just when it is relevant to
them.
