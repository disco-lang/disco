  badmap:
  - Certainly false: badmap(λx. x / 0)([3, 4, 5]) == [6, 7, 8]
    Test failed with an error:
      Error: division by zero.
  - Certainly false: badmap(λx. x)([1, 2]) == [1, 2]
    - Left side:  [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
    - Right side: [1, 2]
  - Certainly false: badmap(λx. x + 1)([3, 4]) > [5, 6]
    - Left side:  [4, 4, 5, 5, 3]
    - Right side: [5, 6]
  divide:
  - Certainly false: ∀a, b. divide(a)(b) * b == a
    Test failed with an error:
      Error: division by zero.
  - Certainly false: ∀a. divide(a)(2) < a
    Found counterexample:
      a = 0
    - Left side:  0
    - Right side: 0
  - Possibly false: ∃a. divide(a)(2) == abs(a) + 1
