-- Qualifiers
------------------------------------------------------------

-- | A "qualifier" is kind of like a type class in Haskell; but unlike
--   Haskell, disco users cannot define their own.  Rather, there is a
--   finite fixed list of qualifiers supported by disco.  For example,
--   @QSub@ denotes types which support a subtraction operation.  Each
--   qualifier corresponds to a set of types which satisfy it (see
--   'hasQual' and 'qualRules').
--
--   These qualifiers generally arise from uses of various operations.
--   For example, the expression @\\x y. x - y@ would be inferred to
--   have a type @a -> a -> a [subtractive a]@, that is, a function of
--   type @a -> a -> a@ where @a@ is any type that supports
--   subtraction.
--
--   These qualifiers can appear in a 'CQual' constraint; see
--   "Disco.Typecheck.Constraint".
data Qualifier
  = QNum       -- ^ Numeric, i.e. a semiring supporting + and *
  | QSub       -- ^ Subtractive, i.e. supports -
  | QDiv       -- ^ Divisive, i.e. supports /
  | QCmp       -- ^ Comparable, i.e. supports ordering/comparison (see Note [QCmp])
  | QEnum      -- ^ Enumerable, i.e. supports ellipsis notation [x .. y]
  | QBool      -- ^ Boolean, i.e. supports and, or, not (Bool or Prop)
  | QBasic     -- ^ Things that do not involve Prop.
  | QSimple    -- ^ Things for which we can derive a *Haskell* Ord instance

instance Alpha Qualifier

-- ~~~~ Note [QCmp]
--
-- It used to be the case that every type in disco supported
-- (semi-decidable) linear ordering, so in one sense the QCmp
-- constraint was unnecessary.  However, in order to do a comparison we
-- need to know the type at runtime.  Currently, we use QCmp to track
-- which types have comparisons done on them, and reject any type
-- variables with a QCmp constraint (just as we reject any other type
-- variables with remaining constraints).  Every type with comparisons
-- done on it must be statically known at compile time.
--
-- However, there's now another reason: the Prop type does not support
-- comparisons at all.
--
-- Eventually, one could imagine compiling to something like System F
-- with explicit type lambdas and applications; then the QCmp
-- constraints would tell us which type applications need to be kept
-- and which can be erased.
