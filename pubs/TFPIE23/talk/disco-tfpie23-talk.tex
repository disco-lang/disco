% Talk outline
% Want to tell you about Disco.
% Goals of disco
% - Teach FP concepts.
%   - At small institution, don't have luxury of
%     teaching intro FP.
%   - Idea of teaching FP + Discrete is not at all new.
% - Connect math & computation
% - Enhance learning
% - Minimize friction.  Many existing approaches use a
%   general-purpose functional language.  But let's talk about that.
% Show example function.
% Haskell implementation:
% - Int/Rational instead of N/Q
% - Can't match on 2n, 2n+1.  Can't write 3n.
% - Have to convert Int to Rational with fromIntegral
% Show Disco implementation.
%   Anecdotally, this works.  Students were able to use it with very
%   little issue.

% Demo
% First, show calculator.  Addition, subtraction, mult, big power
% (arbitrary sized integers), division (fractions)
% Show types of things.  Subtyping.  :type [1,-2,1/3]
% Show subtyping diamond (on slides).
% Back to demo.
% - Show gcd.  Talk about docs, tests, randomized property-based
%   testing.
% - Show zorder. each(zOrder', [0..15])
% - Show module6, using properties to create an assignment.  Exercise
%   4.
% - Show catalan.  Algebraic types, equirecursive types.  Great way
%   to introduce students to algebraic data types.

% Then talk about issues / future work.  Take more or less time as needed.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Functional teaching language
  \item Designed for use in a Discrete Mathematics course
  \item Birthplace: TFPIE 2016, Maryland, USA!
  \item Have used it in a Discrete Math class once, in
    Spring 2022.
  \item Plan to use it again starting next week.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\disco goals}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Teach early CS students basic FP concepts
  \item Help students connect math and computation
  \item Enhance learning with an interactive platform
  \item Minimize notational \& conceptual friction
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{xframe}{Issues / Future work}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Error messages!
  \item Showing multiple type instantiations
  \item Types vs sets
  \end{itemize}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Showing multiple type instantiations}
  What is the most general type of $\lambda x. x - 2$?
  \bigskip

  \onslide<2-> Internally, it is something like $\forall
  a. (\mathrm{HasSubtraction}(a), \Z <: a) \Rightarrow a \to a$
  \bigskip

  \onslide<3-> \dots but we definitely don't want to show that to
  students! \bigskip

  \onslide<4-> We do this instead, but it's confusing:
  \begin{verbatim}
Disco> :type \x. x - 2
λx. x - 2 : ℤ → ℤ
Disco> (\x. x - 2) (5/2)
1/2
  \end{verbatim}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Showing multiple type instantiations}
  What about something like this instead?
  \begin{verbatim}
  Disco> :type \x. x - 2
  λx. x - 2
    : ℤ → ℤ
    : ℚ → ℚ
  \end{verbatim}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Types vs sets}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<+-> $\{2,4,7\}$ is an example of a \underline{\hspace{2in}}
  \item<+-> $\N$ is an example of a \underline{\hspace{2in}}
  \item<+-> In a math class, $\N - \{2,4,7\}$ is a perfectly well-defined,
  countably infinite set.
  \item<+-> In \disco, $\N - \{2,4,7\}$ is a \emph{syntax error}!
  \item<+-> Why the difference, and how do we explain/frame it for
    students??
  \end{itemize}
