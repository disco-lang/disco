Arithmetic
==========

You have already seen some basic arithmetic, in the :doc:`getting
started <getting-started>` section.  In this section, we'll dive
deeper into the arithmetic operations supported by Disco.

Addition and multiplication
---------------------------

The most basic arithmetic operations Disco supports are addition and
multiplication.

- Addition is written using ``+``, for example, ``3 + 5 + 2/3``.
- Multiplication is written using ``*``, for example, ``(-2) * 6 *
  (1/3)``.
- The multiplication sign can also sometimes be omitted, just like in
  standard mathematical notation.  For example:

  ::

     Disco> x : N
     Disco> x = 9
     Disco> 2 * x
     18
     Disco> 2x   -- means the same as 2*x
     18
     Disco> (1 + 3) * (5 - 2)
     12
     Disco> (1 + 3)(5 - 2)  -- means the same as above
     12

All the number types (:doc:`natural numbers </reference/natural>`
``N``, :doc:`integers </reference/integer>` ``Z``, :doc:`fractional
numbers </reference/fraction>` ``F``, and :doc:`rational numbers
</reference/rational>` ``Q``) support both addition and
multiplication.

Order of operations and operator precedence
-------------------------------------------

You probably remember learning about the standard "order of
operations"; Disco knows about this too.  For example, ``1 +
2 * 3`` evaluates to ``7``, not ``9``, since Disco knows the
multiplication should be done first:

::

   Disco> 1 + 2 * 3
   7
   Disco> 1 + (2 * 3)  -- this is the same as 1 + 2 * 3
   7
   Disco> (1 + 2) * 3  -- this is different
   9

The "order of operations" really has to do with *where parentheses
should go*.  If we always wrote parentheses around absolutely
everything, then we wouldn't need an order of operations at all.  For
example,

::

   Disco> x : N
   Disco> x = 2
   Disco> (((2^2) + (3 * x)) + 1) + ((2 + 5)*(x^3))
   67

But writing things this way would be incredibly tedious. Agreeing on
an order of operations---that is, which operations have higher
*precedence*, or priority, than others---allows us to leave out
some parentheses.

::

   Disco> 2^2 + 3*x + 1 + (2 + 5) * x^3
   67

Of course, Disco has many more operators than we have seen so far
(almost 30 in total), but you do not need to memorize the precedence
(*i.e.* order of operations) for all the operators!  You can use the
``:doc`` command to see information about an operator, including its
precedence level.  For example, let's check out the documentation for
``+``:

::

   Disco> :doc +
   This expression has multiple possible types.  Some examples:
   ~+~ : ‚Ñï √ó ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï
   ~+~ : ‚Ñ§ √ó ‚Ñ§ ‚Üí ‚Ñ§
   ~+~ : ùîΩ √ó ùîΩ ‚Üí ùîΩ
   ~+~ : ‚Ñö √ó ‚Ñö ‚Üí ‚Ñö
   precedence level 7, left associative

   The sum of two numbers, types, or graphs.

There is a lot of information here, so let's go through it slowly.
The first few lines tell us some of the :doc:`type <types>`
the addition operator can have.  Don't worry for now about what the various
symbols like ``~``, ``√ó``, and ``‚Üí`` mean; essentially this is telling
us that ``+`` takes a pair of natural numbers and returns a natural
number; or a pair of integers and returns an integer; and so on.  This
fits with the claim made before that all four of the numeric types
support addition.

The next line tells us that the *precedence level* of ``+`` is ``7``.
It also tells us that ``+`` is *left associative*, which means
that if we use multiple ``+`` operations in a row (like ``1 + 2 + 3 +
4``), they will be done from left to right (like ``((1 + 2) + 3) +
4``).

Finally, there is a description of what the operator does, and a link
we can click if we want to read more about it.

If we look at the documentation for multiplication, we can see that it
has a *higher* precedence (8) than addition:

::

   Disco> :doc *
   ~*~ : ‚Ñï √ó ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï
   precedence level 8, left associative

   The product of two numbers, types, or graphs.

   https://disco-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/multiplication.html

The higher precedence level of ``*`` is how Disco knows that it should
come before (*i.e.* have parentheses put around it before) addition.

Exercises
---------

* What is the precedence level of subtraction, and how does it compare
  to the precedence levels of addition and multiplication?  Does this
  make sense given what you know about the order of operations?

* What is the precedence level of the "less than" operator ``<``?
  Does it have higher or lower precedence than addition?  Does this
  make sense?  (*Hint*: think about expressions such as ``y < x + 3``.)

* Rewrite each of the following expressions in an equivalent way using
  as few parentheses as possible.  Use the ``:doc`` command if you
  need to look up the precedence of an operator.  Use Disco to make
  sure that the original expression and your new version still yield
  the same result.

    * ``((1 + 2) + 3) + 4``
    * ``(1 + 2) + (3 + 4)``
    * ``1 + (5 * (x^2))``
    * ``((((2 + 3) * 5) + 2) * 10) * 2``
    * ``x^(2^(3^1))``

Subtraction and absolute value
------------------------------

We can also perform subtraction in Disco, using the usual ``-``
operator.  As mentioned before, we can only do subtraction on integers
(``Z``) and rational numbers (``Q``); however, remember that other
numeric types can be automatically converted into one of these.

The absolute value function is written ``|x|`` or ``abs(x)``.  It's
worth noting that absolte value turns integers into natural numbers,
and rational numbers into fractional numbers.  For example:

::

   Disco> :type -3
   -3 : ‚Ñ§
   Disco> :type |-3|
   abs(-3) : ‚Ñï

Division
--------

Division is written using ``/``.  Only fractional numbers (``F``) and
rational numbers (``Q``) support division.

Integer division
----------------

Division on N, Z that rounds down.

Floor and ceiling
-----------------

``floor(x)``, ``ceiling(x)``.  Definitions.  Cool Unicode notation.
Turns Q into Z, F into N.

Note that ``x // y`` is really just shorthand for ``floor(x / y)``.

Exponentiation
