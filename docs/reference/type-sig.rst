Type signature
==============

A *type signature* declares what :doc:`type <types>` a :doc:`variable
<variable>` has.  It consists of a variable name, a colon, and a type
on one line together.  For example,

::

   x : Z

is a type signature declaring the variable ``x`` to have type ``Z``.

Every top-level :doc:`definition <definition>` must have a type
signature that comes before it.
