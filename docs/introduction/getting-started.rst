Getting started
===============

Welcome to Disco!  Disco is a programming language intended to teach
basic functional programming principles in the context of a discrete
mathematics course.  Even if you've never done any programming before,
this series of tutorials is intended to gently introduce you to the
language from first principles.

To get started using Disco, just `visit Disco Live <https://disco-lang.github.io/disco-live/>`_, where you will be
able to evaluate Disco expressions and edit and run your own
``.disco`` files, all via your web browser, without installing
anything on your computer.

(It is also possible to install Disco on your own computer if you
really want to; `see here for
instructions <https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/#readme>`_.)

A few useful resources as you get started:

* `Documentation for Disco can be found on ReadThe Docs <https://disco-lang.readthedocs.io/>`_.
* If you think you have found a bug in Disco, please `report it on
  GitHub <https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/issues/new/choose>`_.
  Even if you're not sure whether something is a bug or not, it's
  still helpful to see what you're confused about.
* If you have an idea for a new feature, or how to make something less
  confusing, `report it on GitHub as well <https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/issues/new/choose>`_!

Exercises
---------

Disco can be used as a basic calculator.  Enter each of the following
:doc:`arithmetic expressions </reference/arithmetic>` at the Disco
:doc:`prompt </reference/REPL>` and report the results.

- ``2 + 3``
- ``5 - 8``
- ``5 * (-2)``
- ``(1 + 2)(3 + 4)``
- ``3/7 + 2/5``
- ``2 ^ 5``
- ``2 ^ 5000``
- ``2 ^ (-5)``
- ``|3|``
- ``|-3|``

What is similar to what you are familiar with from graphing
calculators or other programming languages?  What is different?
