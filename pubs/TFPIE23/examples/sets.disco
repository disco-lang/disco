-- Exercise D1. For each of exA through exF below, replace the empty
-- set with a *set comprehension* so that the tests all pass, as in
-- the example.  (Remember, Disco will run the tests when you :load
-- this file.)

||| An example to illustrate the kind of thing you are supposed to do
||| in the exercises below.  We have defined the set using a *set
||| comprehension* so that it has the specified elements and the test
||| passes.

!!! example =!= {1, 4, 9, 16, 36}   -- the test specifying the elements of 'example'
example : Set(N)
example = {x^2 | x in {1 .. 6}, x /= 5}  -- a set comprehension defining it

-- Now you try.

!!! exA =!= {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}
exA : Set(N)
exA = {2x+1 | x in {0..7}}

!!! exD =!= {{1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}}
exD : Set(Set(N))
exD = {S | S in power({1..4}), |S| == 3}
