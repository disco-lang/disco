There is no built-in or user-defined type named X
=================================================

This is similar to :doc:`unbound`, but with types.  You have referred
to a type that does not exist.

- Did you spell the name of the type correctly? (Remember that
  capitalization matters!)

- Did you forget to ``import`` a module which defines the type you
  want?
