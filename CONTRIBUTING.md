# Contributing to Disco

Thanks so much for taking the time to contribute to Disco! All contributions are
welcomed and appreciated, all the way from reporting a bug or fixing a single
punctuation mark in the documentation, up to implementing a complex new feature.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Disco and related
websites and tools, which are hosted in the
[disco-lang organization](https://github.com/disco-lang) on GitHub. These are
mostly guidelines, not rules. In particular, you don't need to worry that your
contribution will be ignored or rejected in some way if you don't follow the
guidelines. Use your best judgment, and also feel free to propose changes to
this document in a pull request.

## How can I contribute?

There are lots of ways to contribute to Discoâ€”regardless of your background
knowledge or level of mathematical or programming skill, there is probably a way
you can help. For general advice on contributing to open source projects like
Disco, see
[How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/),
or
[Your first open source contribution: a step-by-step technical guide](https://medium.com/@jenweber/your-first-open-source-contribution-a-step-by-step-technical-guide-d3aca55cc5a6).
The rest of this section walks through specific ways you can contribute and
instructions for how to do so.

### Reporting Bugs

Even if you're not at the point where you would feel comfortable contributing
code or documentation, playing around with the language and reporting any
problems that you find is an immensely valuable way to help make the language
better.

Feel free to [submit a bug report](https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/issues)
for anything that seems like it's not the way it should be, such as a typo or
error in the documentation, a program that yields an error even though you think
it should be accepted, or a program that seems to output the wrong result. Even
if the error turns out to be in your understanding rather than in the
documentation or code, it's still a valuable contribution, since it may point
out a way that the documentation or interface could be improved to help reduce
similar confusion in the future.

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/issues).
Before creating a new issue, you can
[do a quick search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Adisco-lang)
to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is
still open, feel free add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a
new one.

When creating a new issue, explain the problem and include additional details to
help the maintainers reproduce the problem, for example:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem,
  if you can.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the problem**. In many cases this
  may be in the form of some specific Disco code which causes the problem to
  happen. To include some Disco code in the issue, you can use
  [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out
  what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

Not all of these are necessarily required for every single bug report (for
example, to report a typo in the documentation you don't need to do much beyond
point it out); use your judgment, but try to err on the side of including more
information.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a way Disco could be better, or a super-cool new feature
you'd like to see, you can
[submit it on the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/issues),
the same as a bug report. Just describe your idea in as much detail as you can.

### Improving Documentation

Disco has two main types of documentation:

1. Documentation
   [hosted on `readthedocs.io`](https://disco-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
   aimed at users of Disco (students, teachers, _etc._). The source for this
   documentation can be found in the
   [`docs/` directory](https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/tree/master/docs).
   Right now there is only a tutorial for experienced functional programmers,
   but more documents are planned, such as a language reference and a tutorial
   for beginning programmers; you may have ideas for other sorts of helpful
   documents! You can contribute to an existing document or even start a new
   one. For more information about the technical details of contributing to the
   documentation, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

2. [Haddock](https://www.haskell.org/haddock/) documentation in the code, which
   is aimed at developers and those trying to understand the implementation of
   Disco. If you know Haskell, one valuable way to contribute is by reading and
   trying to understand the code (feel free to ask questions in the
   [`#disco-lang` IRC channel on `freenode.net`](https://webchat.freenode.net/#disco-lang)
   along the way!), and adding comments to document what you learn, especially
   in places where the comments are inadequate.

Specific documentation that needs fixing, or specific documentation that needs
to be written, can also be found
[on the issue tracker under the "Documentation" label](https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/labels/Z-Documentation)
(though as explained above, the issues on the issue tracker are by no means an
exhaustive list of documentation improvements that would be helpful).

### Making a Code Contribution

Disco is written in [Haskell](http://haskell.org). The level of Haskell skill
needed to understand and contribute to the Disco codebase varies widely
depending on which part of the code you look at, but generally speaking you will
probably need to be comfortable with standard monads (`Except`, `Reader`,
`State`, `Maybe`) and with standard container types like `Data.Set` and
`Data.Map`. If you'd like to learn enough Haskell to contribute to Disco, we
recommend starting by
[working through these introductory Haskell course materials](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/).

If you'd like to contribute some code but are unsure where to begin, you can
start by looking through
[issues tagged "Low-Hanging Fruit"](https://github.com/disco-lang/disco/labels/C-Low%20Hanging%20Fruit)
in the issue tracker. These are bugs and features which should be appropriate
for someone just getting started to tackle. If you want help understanding or
getting started on a particular issue, feel free to leave a comment on the issue
or ask in the
[`#disco-lang` IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/#disco-lang).

### Development Workflow

Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how making a
contribution actually works? Here's a quick rundown!

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you
   would like to add.
1. _Fork_ [the `disco` repository](https://github.com/disco-lang/disco) (by
   clicking the "Fork" button in the upper-right corner). This will make a copy
   of the repository in your personal GitHub account, that is, you will have
   your own personal copy of the repository under
   `<your-GitHub-username>/disco`.
1. _Clone_ the repository to your local machine by opening a terminal,
   navigating to the directory where you would like to store the `disco`
   repository, and typing
   `git clone https://github.com/your-GitHub-username/disco.git`. (If you don't
   already have the `git` tool, you will have to
   [install it first](https://git-scm.com/downloads).) You should now have a
   subfolder named `disco` containing an up-to-date copy of the repository.
1. Create a new _branch_ for your fix using `git checkout -b BRANCH-NAME`
   (replace `BRANCH-NAME` by some appropriate name based on the feature or fix
   you plan to make).
1. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the
   feature that you want to add.
1. Use `git add` to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot"
   git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.
1. Use `git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here"` to
   store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.
1. Push the changes to your fork on GitHub using `git push origin BRANCH-NAME`.
1. [Submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
   from your fork to the `disco-lang/disco` repository.
1. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the
   issue or bug number associated with your change (if any). For example, you
   can title an issue like so "Added more log output to resolve #4352".
1. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made,
   any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions
   you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no
   pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and
   improve it!
1. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
1. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
   You can simply make additional changes, `add` and `commit` them, and then
   `push` to the same branch. Any additional commits added to the same branch
   will automatically be included in the pull request.
1. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!
1. After your first pull request is merged, it is very likely that you will be
   granted push access to the `disco-lang/disco` repository. This means that
   from now on you can create branches directly within the `disco` repository
   rather than working in your own fork. For more information, see
   [I have push access to the Disco repository, now what?](#i-have-push-access-to-the-disco-repository-now-what).

## I have push access to the Disco repository, now what?

Inspired by
[Edward Kmett](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5n61uh/an_interview_with_haskell_developer_edward_kmett/dc92hcc/?context=8&depth=9),
Disco uses
[The Pull Request Hack](https://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack.html):
anyone who submits a pull request to Disco is likely to be granted push access
in short order.

One benefit is that when working on a new feature, you can create a branch in
the `disco` repository itself (instead of in your own fork) and then open a pull
request from the feature branch to `master`. This is actually _preferred_ since
it makes several things smoother (for example, the `restyled.io` bot works much
better on pulls from local branches than from forks).

Although being given push access does not imply any particular responsibility,
you are welcome to do things such as help review and merge other pull requests,
and help triage, label, and update issues in the issue tracker.

Having push access also means, of course, that you can push directly to
`master`. You are welcome to do so for typos, small fixes, documentation
improvements, and the like; for larger fixes, new features, _etc._ opening a
pull request from a feature branch is still preferred, to give a chance for
others to offer suggestions for improvement.

<!-- ### Pull Requests -->

<!-- The process described here has several goals: -->

<!-- - Maintain Atom's quality -->
<!-- - Fix problems that are important to users -->
<!-- - Engage the community in working toward the best possible Atom -->
<!-- - Enable a sustainable system for Atom's maintainers to review contributions -->

<!-- Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers: -->

<!-- 1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) -->
<!-- 2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides) -->
<!-- 3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details> -->

<!-- While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted. -->

<!-- ## Style Guides -->

<!-- ### Git Commit Messages -->
