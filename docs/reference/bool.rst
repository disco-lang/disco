Booleans
========

The type of *booleans* is written ``Bool`` or ``Boolean``.  There are
exactly two values of type ``Boolean``: ``F`` and ``T`` (which
can also be written ``False`` and ``True``, or ``false`` and ``true``).

:doc:`Logical operators <logic-ops>` can be used to manipulate
``Boolean`` values, and expressions of type ``Boolean`` can be used as
conditions in a :doc:`case expression <case>`.
