\section{Introduction}

The optional arguments of {\ttfamily $\backslash$documentclass$\{$eptcs$\}$} are
\begin{itemize}
\item at most one of
{\ttfamily adraft},
{\ttfamily submission} or
{\ttfamily preliminary},
\item at most one of {\ttfamily publicdomain} or {\ttfamily copyright},
\item and optionally {\ttfamily creativecommons},
  \begin{itemize}
  \item possibly augmented with
    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\ttfamily noderivs}
    \item or {\ttfamily sharealike},
    \end{itemize}
  \item and possibly augmented with {\ttfamily noncommercial}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
We use {\ttfamily adraft} rather than {\ttfamily draft} so as not to confuse hyperref.
The style-file option {\ttfamily submission} is for papers that are
submitted to {\ttfamily $\backslash$event}, where the value of the latter is
to be filled in in line 2 of the tex file. Use {\ttfamily preliminary} only
for papers that are accepted but not yet published. The final version
of your paper to be uploaded to the EPTCS website should have
none of these style-file options.

Using the style-file option
\href{http://creativecommons.org/licenses/}{creativecommons}
authors equip their paper with a Creative Commons license that allows
everyone to copy, distribute, display, and perform their copyrighted
work and derivative works based upon it, but only if they give credit
the way you request. By invoking the additional style-file option {\ttfamily
noderivs} you let others copy, distribute, display, and perform only
verbatim copies of your work, but not derivative works based upon
it. Alternatively, the {\ttfamily sharealike} option allows others to
distribute derivative works only under a license identical to the
license that governs your work. Finally, you can invoke the option
{\ttfamily noncommercial} that let others copy, distribute, display, and
perform your work and derivative works based upon it for
noncommercial purposes only.

Authors' (multiple) affiliations and emails use the commands
{\ttfamily $\backslash$institute} and {\ttfamily $\backslash$email}.
Both are optional.
Authors should moreover supply
{\ttfamily $\backslash$titlerunning} and {\ttfamily $\backslash$authorrunning},
and in case the copyrightholders are not the authors also
{\ttfamily $\backslash$copyrightholders}.
As illustrated above, heuristic solutions may be called for to share
affiliations. Authors may apply their own creativity here \cite{multipleauthors}.

EPTCS recommends using {\ttfamily $\backslash$documentclass[copyright,creativecommons]\{eptcs\}}.\\
Additionally, the title should be set in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case}{title case},
meaning that major words start with a capital letter, and only articles, prepositions and
conjunctions appear in lower case.

\section{Ancillary files}

Authors may upload ancillary files to be linked alongside their paper.
These can, for instance, contain raw data for tables and plots in the
article or program code.  Ancillary files are included with an EPTCS
submission by placing them in a directory \texttt{anc} next to the
main latex file. See also \url{https://arxiv.org/help/ancillary_files}.
Please add a file README in the directory \texttt{anc}, explaining the
nature of the ancillary files, as in
\url{http://eptcs.org/paper.cgi?226.21}.

\section{Prefaces}

Volume editors may create prefaces using this very template,
with {\ttfamily $\backslash$title$\{$Preface$\}$} and {\ttfamily $\backslash$author$\{\}$}.

\section{Bibliography}

We request that you use
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcs.bst}
{\ttfamily $\backslash$bibliographystyle$\{$eptcs$\}$}
\cite{bibliographystylewebpage}, or one of its variants
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcsalpha.bst}{eptcsalpha},
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcsini.bst}{eptcsini} or
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcsalphaini.bst}{eptcsalphaini}
\cite{bibliographystylewebpage}. Compared to the original {\LaTeX}
{\ttfamily $\backslash$biblio\-graphystyle$\{$plain$\}$},
it ignores the field {\ttfamily month}, and uses the extra
bibtex fields {\ttfamily eid}, {\ttfamily doi}, {\ttfamily eprint} and {\ttfamily url}.
The first is for electronic identifiers (typically the number $n$
indicating the $n^\mathrm{th}$ paper in an issue) of papers in electronic
journals that do not use page numbers. The other three are to refer,
with life links, to electronic incarnations of the paper.

\paragraph{DOIs}

Almost all publishers use digital object identifiers (DOIs) as a
persistent way to locate electronic publications. Prefixing the DOI of
any paper with {\ttfamily https://doi.org/} yields a URI that resolves to the
current location (URL) of the response page\footnote{Nowadays, papers
  that are published electronically tend
  to have a \emph{response page} that lists the title, authors and
  abstract of the paper, and links to the actual manifestations of
  the paper (e.g., as {\ttfamily dvi} or {\ttfamily pdf} file). Sometimes
  publishers charge money to access the paper itself, but the response
  page is always freely available.}
of that paper. When the location of the response page changes (for
instance, through a merge of publishers), the DOI of the paper remains
the same and (through an update by the publisher) the corresponding
URI will then resolve to the new location. For that reason, a reference
ought to contain the DOI of a paper, with a live link to the corresponding
URI, rather than a direct reference or link to the current URL of the
publisher's response page. This is the r\^ole of the bibtex field {\ttfamily doi}.
{\bfseries EPTCS requires the inclusion of a DOI in each cited paper, when available.}

DOIs of papers can often be found through
\url{http://www.crossref.org/guestquery};\footnote{For papers that will appear
  in EPTCS and use \href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcs.bst}
  {\ttfamily $\backslash$bibliographystyle$\{$eptcs$\}$} there is no need to
  find DOIs on this website, as EPTCS will look them up for you
  automatically upon submission of the first version of your paper;
  these DOIs can then be incorporated into the final version, together
  with the remaining DOIs that need to be found at DBLP or the publisher's web pages.}
the second method {\itshape Search on article title}, only using the {\bfseries
surname} of the first-listed author, works best.
Other places to find DOIs are DBLP and the response pages for cited
papers (maintained by their publishers).

\paragraph{The bibtex fields {\ttfamily eprint} and {\ttfamily url}}

Often an official publication is only available against payment. However,
as a courtesy to readers that do not wish to pay, the authors also
make the paper available free of charge at a repository such as
\url{arXiv.org}. In such a case, it is recommended to also refer and
link to the URL of the response page of the paper in such a
repository.  This can be done using the bibtex fields {\ttfamily eprint}
or {\ttfamily url}.  The latter field should \textbf{not} be used
to duplicate information that is also provided through {\ttfamily doi} or {\ttfamily eprint}.
You can find archival-quality URLs for most recently published papers
in DBLP, but please suppress repetition of DOI or {\ttfamily eprint} information though {\ttfamily url}.
In fact, it is often useful to check your references against DBLP records anyway,
or just find them there in the first place.

\paragraph{Typesetting DOIs and URLs}

When using {\LaTeX} rather than {\ttfamily pdflatex} to typeset your paper, by
default no line breaks within long URLs are allowed. This leads often
to very ugly output, that moreover is different from the output
generated when using {\ttfamily pdflatex}. This problem is repaired when
invoking \href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/breakurl.sty}
{\ttfamily $\backslash$usepackage$\{$breakurl$\}$}: it allows line breaks
within links and yield the same output as obtained by default with
{\ttfamily pdflatex}.
When invoking {\ttfamily pdflatex}, the package {\ttfamily breakurl} is ignored.

The package {\ttfamily $\backslash$usepackage$\{$underscore$\}$} is
recommended to deal with underscores in DOIs. This is not needed when
using {\ttfamily $\backslash$usepackage$\{$breakurl$\}$} and not {\ttfamily pdflatex}.

\paragraph{References to papers in the same EPTCS volume}

To refer to another paper in the same volume as your own contribution,
use a bibtex entry with
\begin{center}
  {\ttfamily series    = $\{\backslash$thisvolume$\{5\}\}$},
\end{center}
where 5 is the submission number of the paper you want to cite.
You may need to contact the author, volume editors, or EPTCS staff to
find that submission number; it becomes known (and unchangeable)
as soon as the cited paper is first uploaded at EPTCS\@.
Furthermore, omit the fields {\ttfamily publisher} and {\ttfamily volume}.
Then in your main paper, you put something like:

\noindent
{\small \ttfamily $\backslash$providecommand$\{\backslash$thisvolume$\}$[1]$\{$this
  volume of EPTCS, Open Publishing Association$\}$}

\noindent
This acts as a placeholder macro-expansion until EPTCS software adds
something like

\noindent
{\small \ttfamily $\backslash$newcommand$\{\backslash$thisvolume$\}$[1]%
  $\{\{\backslash$eptcs$\}$ 157$\backslash$opa, pp 45--56, doi:\dots$\}$},

\noindent
where the relevant numbers are pulled out of the database at publication time.
Here the newcommand wins from the providecommand, and {\ttfamily \small $\backslash$eptcs}
resp.\ {\ttfamily \small $\backslash$opa} expand to

\noindent
{\small \ttfamily $\backslash$sl Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science} \hfill and\\
{\small \ttfamily , Open Publishing Association} \hfill .

\noindent
Hence putting {\small \ttfamily $\backslash$def$\backslash$opa$\{\}$} in
your paper suppresses the addition of a publisher upon expansion of the citation by EPTCS\@.
An optional argument like
\begin{center}
  {\ttfamily series    = $\{\backslash$thisvolume[EPTCS]$\{5\}\}$},
\end{center}
overwrites the value of {\ttfamily \small $\backslash$eptcs}.
